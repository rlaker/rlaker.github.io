Data scientist currently working at [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/) <i class="fas fa-train"></i>. Before that, I studied the solar wind for my PhD at Imperial College London <i class="fas fa-solid fa-sun"></i>, where I also completed my physics degree <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>.

I enjoy having a play with data and seeing how it can help me with my other hobbies, such as [cooking](/cooking) and [photography](/photos).

I recently started writing a blog, which you can read [here](/blog).



## [Projects](/projects)

* [Hackathon](/projects/hackathon) using reinforcement learning to dis/charge a battery based on fluctuating energy price
* [High altitude balloon](/projects/hab) that recorded images and atmospheric data to an altitude of 35km
* [Visualisations](/vis) made to explain space physics concepts
* [Obsidian](/projects/obsidian) tutorial aimed at use in academia
* [MSci project](/projects/msci) predicting solar wind conditions for Parker Solar Probe's first orbit

## [Cooking](/cooking)

Try out my experimental cooking [page](/cooking). This is how I catalogue and take notes on recipes from around the internet. Created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) so that ingredients connect to recipes, which connect to cookbooks, which connects back to recipes and... you get the idea.

## [Publications](/publications)

Read my [publications](/publications) from my time studying the solar wind with the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter missions. A full list can be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=59iEPNwAAAAJ) <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>.

I also created a short animation to describe my PhD (below), along with some other useful <a href="/vis/">visualisations</a>.
