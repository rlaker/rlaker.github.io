* [Visualisations](/vis) made to explain space physics concepts

* [MSci project](/projects/msci) predicting solar wind conditions for Parker Solar Probe's first orbit

## [Cooking](/cooking)

Try out my experimental cooking [page](/cooking). This is how I catalogue and take notes on recipes from around the internet. Created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) so that ingredients connect to recipes which connect to cookbooks.

## [Publications](/publications)

Read my [publications](/publications) from my time studying the solar wind with the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter missions. A full list can be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=59iEPNwAAAAJ) <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>.

I also created a short animation to describe my PhD (below), along with some other useful <a href="/vis/">visualisations</a>.
