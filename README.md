## Background

I originally made this by forking [academic pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), but I realised that this was detached from its parent [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) so I could not pull updates.

So I followed this [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31327045/switch-theme-in-an-existing-jekyll-installation) answer to change the theme to be [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), so I can now pull in upstream changes.
