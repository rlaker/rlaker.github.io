I am a PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/space-and-atmospheric-physics) studying the solar wind in the inner heliosphere with the new Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter missions. Interested in using multiple spacecraft to measure the 3D shape of large scale structures in the solar wind, particularly the heliospheric current sheet and stream interaction regions.
