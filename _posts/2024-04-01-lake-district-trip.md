One of the benefits of spending large amounts of money on a Fujifilm camera, is that there are enough images to create a travel photobook. We thought it would be fun to create a themed cover to the photobook, so that we can distinguish between all the locations and years on our bookshelf.

Here is our effort for the Lake District trip we enjoyed in December 2023, where we travelled from Penrith to Windermere, Ullswater and Blea Tarn.
