The amount of freely available, high quality, information on people's personal blogs is incredible, and partly the reason for my own blog. However, it is increasingly hard to find this information from a normal search query. Even though I use DuckDuckGo and not the [degrading Google search](https://www.404media.co/google-search-really-has-gotten-worse-researchers-find/), I only really find these kind of articles through RSS feeds and recommendations from other blogs (I keep track of these with [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/about)). 

Turns out there are many alternative search engines that aim to be good at a particular thing:
- [Million short](https://millionshort.com/) skips the first million Google search results
- [searchmysite](https://searchmysite.net/) searches personal websites (like this one)
- [Marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu/) is non-commercial search engine set up by some dude in Sweden. Good at finding data science related answers without Medium popping up everywhere
