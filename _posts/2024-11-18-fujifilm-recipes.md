Looking back at pictures from my Fujifilm X100V over the last few months, I realised I basically just use one recipe (jargon for a fancy in-built filter). This was fine in the summer sunlight, but its a bit too contrasty for the overcast skies over Britain during the winter. After a strike of inspiration I thought I would write down my current recipes/ideas so I don't forget and revert back.


## 1. Astia - all rounder

Based on the built-in Astia/Soft simulation, this is my everyday recipe


- **Film simulation**: Astia/Soft
- **Grain effect**: Weak, Small
- **Colour Chrome Effect**: Weak
- **Color Chrome FX Blue**: Weak
- **White Balance**: Auto, Red +1, Blue -4  
- **Dynamic Range**: DR400
- **Highlights**: +1
- **Shadows**: +1
- **Color**: +2
- **Sharpness**: 0
- **Noise reduction**: -4
- **Clarity**: 0 (I hate how slow it is)

## 2. Portra 400 - Portraits 

The [Portra 400 v2](https://fujixweekly.com/2022/12/16/kodak-portra-400-v2-fujifilm-x-t5-x-trans-v-film-simulation-recipe/) recipe from Fuji X Weekly. Use this for a brighter colour and skin tones in portraits

## 3. Fujicolor Superia 800 - Low mood/overcast 

The [Fujicolour Superia 800](https://fujixweekly.com/2020/07/27/fujifilm-x100v-film-simulation-recipe-fujicolor-superia-800/) recipe from Fuji X Weekly. Use this for a more muted look, works well on overcast days. Haven't got a good shot with this yet, so here is a sample from the original recipe

## 4. Nostalgic Colour - recreate childhood pictures

This [recipe](https://fujixweekly.com/2022/04/04/fujifilm-x-trans-iv-film-simulation-recipe-nostalgia-color/) promises to get that nostalgic look that I love in my childhood pictures. Again, a new for me so here is a sample instead

## 5. City - Architecture

I really like this one for the big skyscrapers around the City of London. 

- **Film simulation**: Classic Chrome
- **Grain effect**: Strong, Large
- **Colour Chrome Effect**: Strong
- **Color Chrome FX Blue**: Weak
- **White Balance**: Daylight, Red -1, Blue -3  
- **Dynamic Range**: DR400
- **Highlights**: -1
- **Shadows**: +1
- **Color**: -1
- **Sharpness**: -1
- **Noise reduction**: -4
- **Clarity**: 0 (I hate how slow it is)

I can't remember where the original recipe was from, but here is my favourite picture with it

## 6. Tri-X - Punchy black and white

I love shooting Kodak T-Max 400 for its dramatic look. This [recipe](https://fujixweekly.com/2020/06/18/fujifilm-x100v-film-simulation-recipe-kodak-tri-x-400/) is a recreation of something similar

## 7. Ilford HP5+ - Everyday black and white

A classic film that I use to be a bit softer of a black and white [recipe](https://fujixweekly.com/2022/03/23/fujifilm-x-trans-iv-film-simulation-recipe-ilford-hp5-plus-400/)
