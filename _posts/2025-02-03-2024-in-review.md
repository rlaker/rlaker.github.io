My [goal for 2024](https://www.ronanlaker.com/why-I-am-starting-a-blog/) was to write a blog. 

I originally envisaged the blog as being primarily about showcasing my work within data, which was definitely the tone for the first half of the year, e.g. 
- [Most controversial movie opinion](https://www.ronanlaker.com/most-controversial-movie-opinion/)
- [How to create professional figures in Matplotlib](https://www.ronanlaker.com/matplotlib-stylesheet/)
- [An interactive guide to linear models](https://www.ronanlaker.com/linear-models-demystified/)

As the year progressed, I began to prefer longer-form essays over data visualisation which reflected my discovery of short essays from writers like [A.A. Gill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36577083-the-best-of-a-a-gill?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=ic4Zq2DknD&rank=1), [Anthony Bourdain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40136.The_Nasty_Bits?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_10) and [George Orwell](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/shooting-an-elephant/).
- [On the subtlety of data science](https://www.ronanlaker.com/subtlety-of-data-science/)
- [RIP Omnivore, welcome Readwise](https://www.ronanlaker.com/rip-omnivore/)
- [Fujifilm X100V recipes](https://www.ronanlaker.com/fujifilm-recipes/)

The last two examples actually got quite a bit of organic traffic just for including keywords the internet cares about.

In the end, I managed to write 14 blog posts and 51 TIL (only publishing 10 on this blog) - meaning I actually hit my stated goal from the beginning of the year! Thanks to a strong final push in December, and some 100 page novellas, I also managed to read [52 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/160528809) and watch [52 films](https://letterboxd.com/rlaker/year/2024/) which I'm pretty chuffed with.

Moving forward into 2025, I want to continue to write essays about any particular topic that piques my interest, whether than be food, photography or data. I see many blogs that try and have a unique selling point, but I want this to be a reflection of what I'm thinking at any given time. In the interest of writing down a goal to be accountable come 2026, I want to:
- write 12 essays
- write 52 TILs
- read 52 books (with fewer cookbooks padding my stats)
- watch 52 films
