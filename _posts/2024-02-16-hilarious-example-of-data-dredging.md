Who knew that margarine consumption is correlated with the divorce rate in Maine? There is even a *very scientific* [paper](https://tylervigen.com/spurious/research-papers/5920_spreading-love-and-margarine-an-examination-of-the-butter-splitter-correlation-in-maine.pdf) on the subject.

This is just one of thousands of [spurious correlations](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) from [Tyler Vigen's](https://tylervigen.com/) hilarious demonstration of data dredging (his figures are even included on the associated [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging)). This is when you take many variables, say 25,237 like on his website, and blindly accept statistically significant correlations. 

Turns out this is a major problem in the more statistical sciences, so much so that they now have a [pre-registration format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preregistration_(science)#Registered_reports) to describe what the study will investigate before any data is investigated.

This project also provides a great example of generating realistic looking content, in the form of *scientific* papers, from LLMs. Each paper shows the sequence of prompts that were used to create it.

The author does point out that:
> The silliness of the papers is an artifact of me (1) having fun and (2) acknowledging that realistic-looking AI-generated noise is a real concern for academic research (peer reviews in particular).  
> The papers could sound more realistic than they do, but I intentionally prompted the model to write papers that _look_ real but _sound_ silly.

Although, I'm sure you could convince some people that [Anne Hathaway films are responsible for the number of votes for Republican senators](https://tylervigen.com/spurious/correlation/5866_the-number-of-movies-anne-hathaway-appeared-in_correlates-with_republican-votes-for-senators-in-tennessee)...
