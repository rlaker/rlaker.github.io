Why can't we just have nice things? My favourite Read-it-later app, Omnivore, was just bought by an AI text-to-speech company and dissolved within 20 days. 

Omnivore was a great little app that allowed you to:
- subscribe to RSS feeds
- subscribe to newsletters with a dummy email
- clip notes from a browser
- highlight articles and do a full text search
- save articles to read offline
- sync with Obsidian to make referencing articles a breeze - rather than my old method of Zotero, which is only really suited for academic research

## Omnivore alternatives

As I wrote in a previous [article](https://www.ronanlaker.com/there-are-other-ways-to-search-the-internet/), I like to curate my own news feed by subscribing to personal blogs via RSS feeds and newsletters. So, like many others I was forced to find a new app. Feedly, Feedbin and Inoreader were the ones that jumped out to me from Reddit [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/yngcr3/looking_for_a_replacement_to_feedly/). People all discussed these as cheaper alternatives to Readwise, but they all required some subscription to get the same set of features omnivore provided for free. So, if I am going to pay for something, why not get the best?

Omnivore was the gateway drug into this world of read-it later apps and RSS feeds. Readwise, and Reader, is the full experience. I've only used it for a week so far, but I am already hooked. It can do everything Omnivore promised above, with these added extras:
- Ability to highlight/search Youtube transcripts
- Suggestions for new articles from other Readwise readers, such as this amazing [DIY reference](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/wisereads/articles/make-it-yourself-1000-useful-t/MIY.pdf) 
- Seamless browser extension to create highlights without leaving the page
- Seamless integration with Readwise so I can actually remember all the advice I read in blogs
- Built with keyboard shortcuts everywhere, making it very easy to sort through the noise
- Inbox/Later/Archive workflow that makes it easy to filter through the noise

They also played a complete blinder by releasing an Omnivore importer a few days after the announcement, which has eased my sense of loss as I can now keep all my highlights from the past year.

## Justifying the Readwise cost

Readwise is clearly not worth it for everyone, but for my own sanity I wanted to outline why I am willing to pay the price.

I want to think more and scroll less. This requires reading more long form and curated content from across the internet and within non-fiction books. Now, I could create my own slightly hacky version of an RSS reader/web-clilpper with Obsidian, matcha and some form of syncing. This would no doubt work and keep me satisfied for a few weeks, but I am up against YT shorts and Reddit in the war for my attention so I need the solution to be slick and rewarding, and for this, I am willing to pay.

Readwise also solves another problem of knowledge retention. I have created over 2500 highlights in the last year and have had the unsettling feeling that I was remembering none of it. While I could go back through my kindle highlights myself, I never do. I had even started writing musings/quotes in a physical notebook before I had this Readwise revelation. But I really need something to occupy me before I open the Reddit time sink and having my knowledge re-surfaced each day is genuinely game changing for me. 

So, I now feel secure in investing more time towards reading, and for me, that is worth it. 

Oh and now I get to be that guy who sends quotes like this
