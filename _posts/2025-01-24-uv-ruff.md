[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) has completely changed the way I think about virtual environments. For many years I have been using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) simply because it is the first type of environment manager I learnt about. It wasn't perfect: the solver was very slow; it was hard to completely delete an environment and the files were hard to locate. As I had invested such effort into the creation of each virtual environment, I found that I would form an attachment to each of them. I was hesitant to destroy them and start from scratch. They were my babies.

But now with uv, I can create and destroy my environments in a fraction of a second. I can kill an environment just so I can try the same code with a different version of Python. I don't care about them anymore. This lack of emotion frees me to be more efficient and follow best practices more willingly.

This is also true for [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/#testimonials), the linter and formatter tool made by the same developers behind uv. I have previously used the [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) formatter with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), but the several second delay annoyed me every time I made a commit. So, I decided to try ruff on a large codebase to see if I could change my attitude... Well turns out that quick is an understatement. It was so good that I had to double check to confirm that any files had been changed. Or in [other words](https://x.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802?mx=2):

Quick tools don't just remove painful barriers but they can allow new ways of working to develop. With uv, someone can run a script I send them without needing additional `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` files. Borrowing the example from [calmcode](https://calmcode.io/course/uv/run):

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#   "requests<3",
#   "rich",
# ]
# ///

import requests
from rich.pretty import pprint

resp = requests.get("https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json")
data = resp.json()
pprint([(k, v["title"]) for k, v in data.items()][:10])

```

This also means you can also [treat python packages like command line tools](https://til.simonwillison.net/python/uv-cli-apps). For example, we can run the [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package like this:

```
uvx cookiecutter gh:simonw/click-app
```

uv will create a new environment so quick that you won't notice this has happened!
