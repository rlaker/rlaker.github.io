Who knows what is going to happen in 2025? I don't either, but I recently discovered "prediction markets" as a way to bet on this future.

[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/) is the largest such site, where users can buy shares for prices ranging from $0 to $1. In this way, the price of the share also represents the probability that this event will occur. 

I'm not much of a gambler, but as said in [From Prediction Markets to Info Finance](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/11/09/infofinance.html):

> If you are a bettor, then you can deposit to Polymarket, and for you it's a betting site. If you are not a bettor, then you can read the charts, and for you it's a news site

I appreciate how you can see the historical prices of each event, with my favourite being the step changes after each Premier League game

I'll just leave this ticker here and pray...
